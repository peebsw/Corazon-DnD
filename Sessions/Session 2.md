title: Last Session Recap
collapse: open

The party begins as prisoners in a brutal mining prison under Warden Jayce Ravencourt. Separated by status, they meet fellow inmates, including Errol, Charon, and the trader Trent. Forced to mine _nitratine_, they uncover prison dynamics and plot their next move. Afiriaâ€™s magical defiance lands them in a punishment chamber, where they discover and free Valerie, a powerful mage linked to a failed rebellion. Learning that influence with the warden requires favor from Trent or the ruthless Bloodhand gang, they seek out Jana, an information broker, who reveals that an inmate named Vermere once found a way off the island without the prison ships. With escape on their minds, the group now turns to the Bloodhand, hoping to gain an edge in their fight for freedom.

#### Notes

- The party approaches the Bloodhands, where a large, half-orc man tries to intimidate them. Tycho stands up to him, and we find out his name is Varrick when he is told off by a small, but brawny elven woman who is preparing a stew. Her righthand knuckles have a lot of scarring. She asks what they ask of Miss Karrell.
- Tycho tells her they wish to speak to the warden. She asks the party to break up a group called the Chainbreakers, to beat them up and teach them a lesson. She tells the group the leader is Errol. 
- Griffith negotiates with Trent for a pencil, paper, and some pain relief. He gives up a ration for this. Amara looks for someone to pickpocket to grab a trinket for Jana. She's caught in the act and after a failed attempt at seduction, she quickly flees.
- The group looks for Errol, sending Judas down to the lower levels to ask around. Judas finds him in his cell. Judas strikes a deal with him: Errol is not to cause any trouble until they leave, and Judas will not beat him up. They come to an agreement.
- Amara asks Jana about her missing belongings and Veremere and Jana asks her what she thinks will happen, especially regarding Valerie. She claims to know two things about Amara. Jana tells her that her missing belongings are likely still on the ship, as it has not left yet. 
- She is told that the carts that Vermere escaped on go out every half an hour. After the ship leaves, there probably won't be another one for a month.
- Griffith collects his ink, pen, parchment, and mint. The group discusses their options, then decides to seek out the Bloodhand. They want to see if that will get them an audience with the Bloodhand right away, or whether they should take plan B and escape in the carts.
- Judas talks to the Bloodhand leader and tells her the problem is taken care of. After the group works for a bit, Griffith and Tycho are the ones to go together up to see the warden. They encounter Jayce and a man dressed up like a general with medals. The two party members introduce themselves. 
- Tycho explains that his kingdom was having a crisis, so he went to the royal academy to become a knight to deal with it. However, he lacked the aptitude to get back to his family, so he cheated. He was caught and sent off to prison, to which the warden asks what the threat was. It was a dragon, which seems to disturb the warden. The warden eventually agrees that Tycho should be freed, but not Griffith. 
- As they conclude their conversation, a storm forms outside. The warden rushes out, leaving his office unattended. The others, outside, start feeling the effects of the storm and they hear Valerie call out: "Mother, please send down your aid!" Lightning bolts begin to strike -- not only her, but the rest of the prison. 
- Griffith finds a set of keys for several sets of prison doors. On the walls, there is a ceremonial rapier. He takes a few fistful of documents. Tycho writes a quick letter of apology as the two leave. 
- There is chaos outside, and the party runs up to the ship, struggling past the groups of people rushing onto them. They see the warden on the ship, along with Valerie on the shore. The group searches the ship for their items as the warden hangs back to face Valerie.
- The group finds their belongings, and Judas finds a chest that belonged to a mercenary of some kind, with martial equipment inside. 
- Lightning strikes the mast of the ship, setting it on fire. Griffith and Tycho set to work to cut it down as Amara raids the navigator's quarters for maps and a compass. The group finds a life boat and some rations. They hop on. A man tries to join them, but Judas blasts him out of the sky. Amara navigates as Griffith rows, and Judas concentrates on the *Find Familiar* ritual.
- They are a day away from the next area. In the distance, they hear the Above and Beyond. The group is aiming westward, towards a smaller island with the town of Bellnar on it. The group will arrive on its north-eastern shore, which will put them in the middle of nowhere. 
- After a few hours, the boat starts taking on leaks. The group manages to take the boat ashore just as it sinks. The settlement on the island has about twenty people.
