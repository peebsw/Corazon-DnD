#### Notes

- Morning comes. Amara goes to "run a quick errand" by returning to the man from the previous night. She hands over the nitratine she pilfered from Griffith's bag earlier. He accuses Amara of handing him a fake powder, as she got it far too quickly. He slams the door in her face and locks the door.
- The party makes their way to the ship they have been on the past few days, the Stormskipper. Griffith boards and tries to find a quiet spot to sit in, to avoid any unwanted attention. Amara offers her condolences to the captain aboard. 
- The ship sails towards Kaeloris, Kaelendell's capital. The party sails for one and a half weeks before arriving to the capital. There are cathedrals, a citadel, housing the three heads of the city.
	- Eminence district, farthest from the harbor. Houses nobility, Arx Arcanum, the ultimate academy reserved for the nobles.
	- Harbor district, northeast of the city. Trade heart of the city and all of Kaelendell. Fairly clean, but slums to the edges are neglected to support Kaeloris Academy of Transmutative Arts with a specialization on alchemy.
	- Third district houses Royal Institute of Magical Studies of Kaeloris. Main academy for all to study. 
- Party finds themselves at the edges of the harbor district. The ship docks, and the party leaves the ship. People swarm the ship, trying to sell them trinkets. Someone slips something to Amara in the chaos, a letter.
	- There is no signature on the letter.
	- Amara is confirmed bi.
- Amara inspects the envelope. It seems mundane.
- Judas hears his patron. He praises Judas for being obedient and tells him that the woman he is to meet lives in the nobility district of the city. He's made a little deal with her, and he's to help her. Once he's done, he'll have done his duty for a while and he will continue supplying Judas his powers. He tells him to get to work.
- The party talks for a bit. Judas leaves behind Prince before departing, requesting that Tycho and Griffith find a bathhouse. Amara wishes them luck and the two depart.
- Tycho and Griffith decide to get information about the dragon god. Tycho goes to a place of worship for more information, and Griffith goes to the academy. 
- Judas approaches the seemingly welcoming home that he was sent to. He is greeted by someone at the door, who calls him the awaited guest. Judas says he was told this was the home of Karella, who is awaiting him. He is led through the giant house to the master bedroom. She asks him for help with demonic forces, to which he agrees to an exorcism.
- Amara looks for the two men that the paranoid man mentioned in the heart of the capital. She comes across someone who says he knows Nash. He tells her she ought to avoid them. 
- Griffith avoids the academy with trepidation and finds an inn for the group. There, a troupe catches his eye. He meets with a halfling named Jasper Starwynd, who claims to know him from their time at the academy. Griffith expresses confusion, but eventually invites Jasper up to his room to discuss things further in private.
- Judas is led to the basement for the exorcism. He is led to a dark room, which seems almost like a jail cell. He feels a sudden sharp pain in his backside, then multiple. There are people waiting inside with knives in their hand, stabbing Judas. Judas is stabbed and grappled. The woman calls in saying, "Sorry, this is the only way!" 
- Judas sends a message to Prince relaying his location and need for help. Tycho hears it and runs towards the scene, following Prince's lead. He barges in, sword drawn. 
- The woman, covered in blood, calls out, "Why isn't this working? I gave you a soul like you wanted!"
- Tycho runs up to her to try to tackle her and jumps her. She says she was advised to kill him, there wouldn't be any consequences, and that it would solve her curse. She explains that her family has a curse inflicted upon them by a devil, who promised them that if they provided it with a soul, he would lift the curse. She prayed to another god, who promised her that sacrificing Judas would solve her problems -- which it hasn't. So now she's killed someone for no reason and she doesn't know why it didn't work.
- She directs Tycho where to go. Outside they are digging a grave, and Tycho spots Judas' mutilated body. He tries to pour a healing potion down his throat. A few of the stab wounds close, but he does not rise. 
- Tycho understands why the ritual didn't work. Something seems to be keeping Judas' soul in his body. The dead body seems to be regenerating. Tycho tells them he only has two hands, one to bring Judas to a temple, and one to bring them to justice. 
- Tycho notices that the younger man digging the grave is her son. He takes him and his mother to a guardpost. They surrender themselves, and Tycho tells the guards that they murdered Judas for the sake of a devil. 
- Judas has a talk with his patron, who implies that this process of killing and reviving has happened several times, each time taking longer. He tells Judas to give up. The devil did not get the soul because Avarion already has it. 
- Judas awakes and tells Tycho no temples. Tycho argues that he needs to be healed; Judas tells him to take him somewhere quiet, which confuses Tycho. He asks to be taken to the inn.
- His patron tells him that every time he dies from now on, he will return weaker. 
- Amara looks for information. She finds that the people in the slums are being treated unfairly, and a group is looking for a certain powder that might help them achieve their goals to change that. She hears that Nash is trying to keep a low profile; the other guy is just off the grid.
- She asks around the area to try to figure out who is in support of the group.
- Jasper tells Griffith about a plot in Ethos, of a plot to overthrow the current king. There is also talk of black powder spreading, and there has been conflict about that. There is also an odd story about the prison island being broken out of. Griffith asks if he knows anybody who might know about dragons, Jasper directs him to the academy. They have a talk on the nature of whether forgetting and moving on is better, or whether one should face the past. Griffith apologizes for the heavy topic and buys Jasper a drink to decompress and chat.
- Judas and Tycho return. Griffith escorts Judas upstairs to recover while they wait for Amara. When Amara returns, the group enters the room for a chat about what happened. 
- Judas explains he was a part of a cruel cult run by a woman named Magnolia, his mother. He was raised in the cult of Avarion, under a false prophet who could claim she could predict the future, and she was teaching his sister, Abelia, all about it. Judas is not his name, he is not technically alive. He decided to get out of the cult to escape his death date. He made a deal with Avarion in desperation, as he was young. He did not know the consequences. It has been 50 years since then, and he has been stuck at that age. He has died a few times throughout, each time he is sent to purgatory. Avarion reminds him he can stop this if he gives him his entire life and soul. 
- Griffith expresses anger, to which Avarion tells him he meddles too much. The party decides that Griffith and Judas will go to the academy, and Tycho and Amara will go to the temples to ask around. Griffith tries to dissuade them from doing so, as they are currently in conflict with a god, and cannot rely on other gods to protect them. The two disagree. Griffith excuses himself, as he is lightheaded.
- Tycho talks to Judas about the time at the house. He tells him that seeing him bloodied nearly drove him to command a mother to kill her son, or vice versa. Judas tells him he would never command him to kill for him. They part.
