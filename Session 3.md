title: Last Session Recap
collapse: open

After arriving at the Bloodhands, the party is met with hostility from a half-orc named Varrick, whose bluster is quickly cut down by a stern elven woman with scarred knuckles. She offers them a deal: deal with a gang called the Chainbreakers, led by Errol, in exchange for an audience with Miss Karrell. Griffith barters for writing supplies and pain relief, while Amara’s attempt to steal a trinket for Jana goes awry, forcing a hasty retreat. Judas locates Errol and negotiates a truce instead of a brawl. Meanwhile, Jana shares insights about Veremere’s escape and hints at Valerie’s unsettling powers. With new supplies in hand, the group decides to meet the Bloodhand directly. Judas reports Errol has been “handled,” and Griffith and Tycho are allowed to speak with the warden. Tycho confesses to cheating in the royal academy to face a dragon threatening his kingdom, which earns him the warden’s sympathy, though the rest of the party is denied clemency. Their meeting is cut short by a sudden storm and Valerie’s divine invocation. As lightning tears through the prison, Griffith seizes the chance to loot the warden’s office. The group fights through chaos to reach the ship, reclaim their gear, and escape on a lifeboat. Amara navigates while Griffith rows, Judas begins casting _Find Familiar_, and the party sails toward the remote island of Bellnar. After barely making it ashore before their boat sinks, they find themselves near a tiny settlement of just twenty people—stranded, but free.

#### Notes
- The party washes up on a fairly large island, larger than the prison island. The island's climate is reminiscent of Spain, and there are a few people fishing on the shore, milling about. Griffith, Tycho, Judas, and Amara head into town. In town, they are noticed by villagers, one of whom seems to summon someone from inside a hut.
- The man is a disheveled, half-elf man, with a large beard. He asks the party if they are also stranded. He tells us that his name is Harlan Avery. He asks the party what the storm was, and then asks the party if they'd rather not be stranded. He asks the party where they want to go, then suggests going straight to Bellnor, where they can take a proper ship to the mainland. 
- Amara asks how the party would get there. He suggests walking, or taking the party there on his next trading trip. The party says they'd prefer to travel with him, and he asks for a favor.
- He explains that there are things coming out and taking fish from the villagers. Amara asks what they look like. Harlan explains that they are amphibious, with an odd eel-like look, with four legs. He has seen them use electricity before. Harlan goes on to say that when one of them crawled out of the water, it was glowing. 
- As the party enters the hut, they notice that there is a familiar (to some) tiefling -- Afiria. Harlan deduces that the party are all escaped prisoners and implies he would have done the same. Harlan asks everyone what they're about. 
- Judas tells everyone that he is looking for information on his travels and introduces his magpie, Prince. 
-  Harlan and Griffith bond over having beards and being half-elves. Judas threatens to shave Griffith.
- Tycho explains that he was formerly a student of the royal academy. He explains that he wants to go back to the mainland, back west to his family as soon as possible. 
- Harlan suggests they could take a ship, around the entire island; however, certain conditions on the bay would make it unfavorable, even if it is the quickest option. 
- Harlan turns his attention to Afiria, who explains that she knows very little about herself. 
- Harlan asks Griffith what brings him here, why not stay on the island. Griffith says there isn't much of interest on the island. Harlan implies he has a secret, Griffith commiserates and says they should both keep their secrets.
- Afiria flies straight up to take a look around, catching a small child's attention. 
- The party walks around. Judas asks a man about freshwater fish, and the man tells Judas there aren't any around. Harlan is the one who goes out to trade the fish they gather. The man says that there are 5 families on the island, and Harlan, who just arrived. He isn't sure who Harlan is, but he is very helpful. He appeared one day, and randomly decided to help them. Judas leaves him with a gold coin.
- Amara checks to see if there is any place of worship. She finds a small makeshift shrine made to their god of fishermen. There are trinkets all around. She prays for a bit, holding one of her necklaces, then looks for food.
- Tycho looks for a tavern, or an eatery. He finds a larger building. The people inside are initially weary of him, so he introduces himself to a group. They offer him some fish. 
- Evening comes, the party heads to the beach. There is calm, nothing at first. Then the sea begins to glow. Creatures begin to emerge from the sea.
Initiative:
	- 22 Judas 
	- 18 Afiria 
	- 10 Griffith 
	- 8 Amara 
	- 3 Tycho
	- 3 Prince
- The party defeats two of the eel monsters. Griffith investigates the body, finding that the insides are seemingly filled with electricity. He makes a note of it. 
- Amara notices that it seems like the creature's heart is charged. The electricity seems to be fading as it loses its life. Griffith sees more lights on the horizon, swirling under the water.
- Amara pokes the heart, causing it to explode and release its charge. Griffith cuts out the heart of the second with an unnatural ease, and finds that it still pulses even after it has been severed. He slips it into his bag.
- Tycho and Griffith discuss whether it might be connected to Valerie, and Harlan overhears. Tycho explains that they released her, and Harlan asks if she left the island. They speculate that it might be contained to the area.
- The party returns to Harlan's hut. Tycho asks about medical supplies, whereupon Harlan reveals a hatch in the ground with emergency supplies. He pulls out a chest full of valuables. He gives some to Tycho, and some medicinal herbs for Griffith.
- Before bed, Judas scarfs down some fish. He explains that his parents made him eat fish while the others ate other things, and he grew to hate fish. Amara does not relate.
- Come morning, the party boards Harlan's sailboat, on route to Bellnor, southeast along the coast of the island. Then west, until they reach the island. It will take about a day of travel. 
- The party reaches the city. It is massive, built from large amounts of stone. Harlan says goodbye to the party, and adds that if they stop by the Salty Wench, to send his regards to Seraphine there. He gives the party directions, then departs.
- Tycho asks Griffith about why he writes so much in his book. Griffith explains that it's to help him recall, as actively making use of his memory gives him terrible headaches. Tycho asks about how the warden told them that he and someone else were running around causing trouble. Griffith reminds him that he planned to leave them all behind in the prison. Griffith shuts the conversation down, and they continue on.
- The party moves on, heading to the Salty Wench, which is run-down. The tavern owner seems to be asleep, though she startles awake with a dagger as Tycho approaches her. She seems exasperated at the mention of Harlan. She explains that getting them on a ship will be around 50 gp for each, and they have very little options. Tycho explains that he plans to negotiate, and they are not entirely out of options. 
- She disagrees, and says they seem fit for one type of work. She directs them to a board of jobs. Judas sees a bounty for him (albeit with no picture), and quickly shoves it in his mouth when the party notices him grabbing it. 
- Some of the jobs include:
	- Collector wanting people to look into a ghost ship in the seas southwest of the city. - 2000 gp
	- People to taste test a new ale called Grog, per pint will be 20 gp
- Judas explains that the bounty was for him, and that was why he was acting suspicious. The party decides they will go and do the grog job first, then the ghost ship.
