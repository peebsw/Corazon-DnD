title: Last Session Recap
collapse: open

The party stumbles into a strange drinking challenge at a hidden brewery, where bizarre and dangerous drinks cause hallucinations, damage, and even temporarily turn Griffith into a tiny rabbit-like creature. After resting at an inn and learning more about each other—including Tycho’s past with a black dragon—they pursue a ghost ship bounty. They meet Morgas Fen, a smuggler who insists the ghost ship is just a cover for pirates that stole his cargo. Sailing aboard the _Stormskipper_ with a rough but capable crew, the party journeys through increasingly ominous seas. On the sixth day, they encounter a fog-shrouded vessel that turns out to be a massive mimic. A chaotic battle begins as the mimic grabs and injures multiple party members, but they fight back and narrowly win.

#### Notes

-  The captain notices that the helmsman, Vess, has passed. He tries to shake her awake, but to no avail. The mimic's corpse, an acidic substance, dissolves on the ocean's surface. Judas tries to figure out what they will tell Morgas Fen. Griffith suggests using the captain as a witness, to which Judas says that grief might cloud his judgement. Griffith dismisses this and goes to steady the ship.
- Tycho looks at the disintegrating corpse, trying to determine how they will recover items from within it.  Tycho summons a familiar, a quipper named Vulpy, and sends it into the corpse. The moment the familiar enters the creature's insides, it feels as though it enters another plane entirely. For a moment, Tycho feels as though their connection is about to be severed, but it does hold. It finds itself in a fluid that is painful. Among the fluid, there are remains of all sorts of creatures. It seems the mimic took out at least two ships' worth of people. Among the fluid are a few crates that are slowly being eaten away by the acid. 
-  The quipper returns with a small, narrow box. It looks to have been ornamental, though the acid has worn it down. Tycho descends to get both the fish and the box and passes it up to Judas. He tells Judas that there is more cargo below the water. 
- Across the ship, Amara has gone to the captain. She sits with him for support. Griffith avoids looking at the scene. The rest of the ship's crew comes aboard as the reality of the death of Vess sets in. They are smugglers, not usually fighting, and are shocked by the loss. 
- Tycho and Judas examine the box. Judas finds a few cracks in the side and pops it open. There are scrolls inside. They look like the ship's logbook, containing information about the crew and cargo. It states the ship contains grain, which is incongruous to what Morgas Fen claimed would be on the ship. Tycho and Judas show it to Griffith, who suggests they send another familiar down. After a bit of hesitation, Judas sends Prince down as a parrot fish. 
- Prince sees much of the same, a massive store of corpses and not much else. Judas dismisses Prince before he dissolves.
- As they finish up, Yuna, the boatswain, approaches the group. She asks them if they got what they wanted, and Judas explains that no, they only got the boat logs. Yuna speculates that the mimic just ate whatever ship it came across. Judas notes that they found no proof that it ate the smuggling ship. He tells Yuna that they will have to go back to report the situation to Morgas, and tells her she may have to come with them. Yuna agrees, though she states she will go for a different reason altogether. She states her anger at her boss having sent them, a smuggler's ship, to deal with whatever the mimic was. Judas suggests killing their boss, to which Yuna does not agree.
-  The group sets out to go talk to Morgas Fen, along with the rest of the crew from aboard the ship. They return to the smuggler's den, down the basement stairs, where Morgas Fen awaits them with visible disinterest. Judas tells him a mimic ate his belongings, to which Morgas Fen expresses confusion regarding what a mimic even is. The ship's crew chimes in, expressing their outrage. Morgas Fen states he was looking for his trade ship, but he was not dealing in grains. Judas suggests he go and look for it himself. 
- Griffith persuades Morgas to pay them for the services they have rendered. Though they did not return with the cargo, they gave him information about the beast and slayed it, clearing the path for whoever would go next. Morgas concedes and hands them 250 gp in total. Griffith briefly tries to intimidate him into a higher payout, but fails. They conceded and make their way out.
- Judas asks the ship captain if he could ferry them to the mainland for payment. The captain asks for 50 gp to pay for burial costs. Judas says he needs to go to Kaeloris. He asks them to wait for them to depart the next day. 
- The party goes to the bank of Kaelendell to cash their checks. The bank is luxurious, over the top in its display of wealth. Griffith steps in, but the rest hang back because they stink. Griffith casts prestidigitation on everyone to let them in, and they approach the counter to cash their check. She tells them they need a permit to cash their check, then sends them with a different check up to room 32B to cash their other check. Griffith breezes through the paperwork, finding them a loophole that speeds up their process. The party grabs some mints and free quills.
- The party then goes to a pawn shop that claims, "We sell everything and we buy anything!" A young man at the counter greets them. Judas hands off the three longswords, to which the young man offers to buy them for 25 gp. Judas tries to bargain for 30 gp, 10 for each sword. The man raises it to 27.5 gp, to which Judas takes it.
-  Judas and Tycho buy some incense, Tycho inquires about magical items. The man brings out a bottle that contains what they call "liquid ice" inside, selling it for 25 gp. Upon impact, it forms a wall of ice. He also shows him a bottle with magical dust that will light up anything. There is also a molotov cocktail. 
- Griffith buys some incense, manacles, and a diplomat's kit. Amara asks for jewelry, and investigates a box of secondhand jewelry. She finds an odd looking ring that has an inscription on the side -- a ring of restful sleep. It grants the user the effects of a long rest in 6 hours. It costs 2 gp, as the seller is unaware of its properties. 
- The party returns to the bar that serves grog. They are greeted by the half-orc woman who is drinking effortlessly. The human man has left, though the two dwarves are still there. The bartender tells them he can't give them the deal from before, but he will give them some free grog. Griffith gives him his waterskin for some grog on the road. He tastes some to determine its effects. It tastes like it will give the drinker a big tummy ache, the acid in stomach kind. 
- Judas drinks one like a shot and belches out fire. He drinks another and finds his throat burned with acid.
-  Tycho downs a glass of grog, taking it as easily as one might drink water. It seems to impress the half-orc woman, who looks at him with expectation. Tycho burps up a flaming burst of fire. He asks the bartender how they even make the grog, to which the bartender says he HAS proven himself to be quite the enjoyer. 
- RECIPE FOR GROG:
	  4 parts rum, 2 parts absinthe, 1 part pickle juice, splash of lime juice, a splash aqua regis, sprinkle of cinnamon. 
- Griffith convinces Amara to take a shot by saying he will let her ride his shoulder if it comes down to it. The rest join in, and toast to a job... done. 
- Judas drinks and immediately falls facefirst onto the floor. Griffith and Amara take a bit of acid damage, Tycho is poisoned. 
- The party returns to the inn to sleep. Amara sneaks out to complete her personal bounty and enters an abode where a paranoid man resides. He explains that he hoped Amara would know where to find the black powder, as it has the potential to replace magic itself with its power. He heard that the prison colony and castle potentially had something even stronger. He promises to give her gold so long as she can bring it to him. 
- He tells Amara that a friend of his at the capital said they had the stuff at the academies, as they experimented with it there. The prison colony probably had it and was developing it. He says he just needs some for himself, as he's something of an alchemist. He says he knows the powder has some weird material from the prison island, but he doesn't know the specifics.
- Amara asks if she retrieves the powder, would he tell her the complete formula. He reluctantly acquiesces, but says it would take a while depending on the complexity of the formula. It could take a couple of weeks, but he says he will pay well. 
- Amara asks for his name and the names of his friends at the capital. He agrees, and says there is a man in Kaeloris named Old Man Gnash, who they say is insane but knows a few things. There's also Cricket Varn, who might be able to help. 
- Amara tries to return to the inn but is stopped by a dwarf navyman. She casts sleep on him and tries to pickpocket him. He has a saber, a uniform, and his wallet. His wallet has a picture with his seven kids. Amara returns, but Griffith catches her but doesn't say anything and goes back to sleep.
- Amara snoops through Judas' stuff. She finds a small book with pages added to it. It is about the size of a light novel. The handwriting is awful, rivaling a doctor's signature, written in celestial. There are pages upon pages, and some have sketches and some pressed flowers. The handwriting goes from very sloppy to neater. Towards the middle of the book is where the handwriting's quality takes a sharp downturn.
	- The sketches are all sketches of people with names. As the book goes on, there are different qualities of sketches. At the beginning, it looks like a 10 year old has drawn them. Towards the middle of the book, the person has practiced, then at the end the sketches improve until the point where the handwriting quality went down, at which point the sketches disappear.
	- One of the sketches has a name in Common: Abelia.
		- The way she is sketched, she almost looks like a younger version of Judas.
		- There are also a few sketches of younger Judas and Abelia holding hands.
	- When the writing is bad, there are two sentences in Common: I wish for the flower fields. I miss my sister.
	- At the end is a crude drawing of all three of the party.
- Amara moves towards Tycho's stuff. She finds basic adventuring gear, some incense, the icy potion he bought. He also has a signet ring. He seems to be travelling light. 
- Amara looks through Griffith's stuff. She takes a few papers and a bit of nitratine.
