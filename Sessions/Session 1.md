#### Notes

- It is the year 258, the year of mankind. The world is developing but conflict remains. The big 3 are competing for expansion into the wilderness. Our story begins on the north island cluster, under control of the kingdom of [[Kaelendell]] on a ship, The Above and Beyond.
- The party begins with the group in manacles, the spellcasters are gagged to prevent them from casting any spells. The group are being led to massive pits in the ground -- a sort of mine. The group are forced out and assembled in the courtyard, where a man addresses them, claiming that they have all wronged the king and will be forced to work off their prison sentences. The prison is called *nitratine*. 
- The group is brought into their accommodations, shoddy cells. Depending on their standing, some are brought into different levels of the prison complex. There are a low amount of buildings in the courtyard. This is explained as they are brought to the pits, where there are stairs on the sides, leading into the depths. Those without noble titles are brought to the lower levels, where the common scum are kept. As they travel through the mine shafts, a cavelike prison system, a few cells they pass by show that there are no backs to their cells -- only a sheer drop to the water below outside.
- As three of the group, [[Afiria]], [[Amara]], and [[Judas]], near a cell, someone greets them: *"Ooh, fresh blood has arrived!"* Someone else says, "Shut up, [[Charon]]." He tells them that [[Charon]] has been driven mad by his time in the cell, and he introduces himself as [[Errol]]. 

```ad-note
 [[Afiria]] is an undead winged tiefling who has been brought back to life by some sort necromancy. Her hair is mid-to-long length, somewhere between black and grey, her skin is fully dark grey.
```
 
```ad-note
[[Amara]] is also a tiefling, medium-sized. She has a few scars on her face and her body, as well as glasses. She has dark blue hair, short, that reaches her chin. She also has a lot of piercings. 
```

```ad-note
 [[Judas]] is the third tiefling. He is missing his hat, as they took it away. He is about 5'9" and has really long, curly, thick hair. He is covered in scars and is wearing quite elegant attire despite being thrown in with the common people. The entire left side of his face is barren and scarred. His one working eye stares with disgust.
```

- Their prison cell does have a back wall, but also has "windows." Really, more like holes carved into the wall that create an unpleasant backdraft.
- [[Errol]] tells them they will be woken up very early, and that they will need to adapt. He also tells them to not mind [[Charon]] too much; he is a good guy, deep down. [[Judas]] asks him if he's always so mean; [[Errol]] tells him he's been in there for 10 years. [[Afiria]] goes to the window to make a mark to count the days.
- The other two are led further up in the prison complex. The cells look like they're carved out of rock, but they seem to have reinforcements for the roofs of the hallways. They are told they are lucky to be up there, and that there is only one person *down there.* The person introducing himself says he is [[Sir Gideon of Ashford]].
- [[Tycho Hortensis|Tycho]] looks like he holds an aristocratic air. He is pleading, trying to get the attention of one of the guards, begging to get the attention of the warden. 
- [[Judas]] peers over the edge of the cliff in their cell. It seems like a 40-50 ft. drop. He asks [[Charon]] if people usually jump; [[Charon]] tells him that those who have, have died. [[Judas]] asks if other people have been mean to him and promises he won't let anyone hurt him anymore. In exchange, he tells [[Charon]] to tell him any information he comes across. 
- [[Judas]] asks if [[Afiria]] did something bad to be put in jail; [[Afiria]] is quiet at first, then says she was thrown in as they don't like the way she looks. 
- The next morning comes and the morning guards start to wake everyone up rather brusquely. As they do so, they gather everyone up in the courtyard up top. There are quite a lot of people, approx. over a thousand. Everyone is lined up in front of a podium, where a very nicely dressed man is standing. He introduces himself as [[Jayce Ravencourt]], the warden of the prison. He tells them this has been a mining facility and recently they have found deposits of *nitratine*. They are valuable to the king and the king wants them to work their way to freedom by mining it.

Rough Schedule
- 6 am: Morning gathering, fed.
- 8 am: Work in the mines, or the fields.
- 12 pm: Short food break.
- 12:30 - 6 pm: Work
- After 6 pm: Free time
- 10 pm: Curfew

- The group is gathered into the dining hall, then brought into the mines afterwards. They are tasked with finding *nitratine*. [[Judas]] fakes working. Someone sidles up to him, and they seem well-fed. [[Trent]] the trader explains that he trades and can get anything [[Judas]] might want, so long as he's paid in kind. He has certain contacts with a few of the higher ups, who sometimes let him "get things."
- [[Judas]] and [[Griffith]] talk; [[Judas]] tells [[Griffith]] he's in there for murdering his entire family. [[Tycho]] tells him he's in there for cheating in the royal academy, and his punishment will be for 6 months. [[Judas]] suggests they go together to see the warden, if [[Tycho]] is going to go. [[Tycho]] explains that instead of using magic, he used potions to cheat his way through the academy. [[Griffith]] admonishes him for it, and [[Judas]] tells him casting magic is easy and tries to poke [[Tycho]] with mage hand, which [[Tycho]] parries. The group is scolded for their spellcasting.
- [[Amara]] eavesdrops and pretends to work, but does not immediately reply to the [[Trent]]'s query as to what brought them in. 
- [[Afiria]] casts *Command* on the guard. She says "serve", seeking to get the guard to mine for her. The guard fails his save and starts mining for [[Afiria]] as she takes a break. She rushes the guard to get the spear, and [[Trent]] skedaddles. [[Afiria]] rushes to follow [[Trent]]. [[Tycho Hortensis|Tycho]] approaches the guard and tackles him as and [[Amara]] rushes to follow with her pickaxe. 
- The guards approach from both ends; [[Afiria]] calls out and says they're trying to catch the runaway, [[Amara]] backs her up. [[Trent]] has connections, so this isn't believed. 
- The guards come to help the guard that [[Tycho]] tried to punch. He threatens the group with a double shift for their actions after nearly punching [[Judas]].
- The group are brought down to a room whose entrance seems to be covered in some runes to seal something in -- maybe abjuration? The room is dark, there is a woman strapped to a chair. The group are strapped to chairs that shoot off electricity. Everyone who does not pass a con save gains one level of exhaustion. [[Judas]] tries to speak to their patron and is basically told they fucked around and found out. 
- [[Tycho]] tries to speak to the woman. She seems to be gagged and has a helmet that has taken away her senses. [[Judas]] names her [[Valerie|Edith]].
- [[Amara]] frees her from her helmet. [[Griffith]] and [[Judas]] free her from the bindings. She explains that she was locked up for trying to make magic more commonplace. She claims she can cast fly; she is potentially very accomplished.
- [[Judas]] knows there was a small rebellion that was crushed by the king's forces. They were trying to establish magic as a right for all, but it unfortunately didn't get very far. The main lead was a woman named [[Valerie]]. The woman says that might have been her name.
- The group sleep behind their chairs to shield themselves from her electricity. Then, after the long rest, the group rebinds themselves to their chairs before they come to get them.
- [[Griffith]] rebinds everyone, including [[Valerie]]. He leaves the bindings a bit loose for her, to help her escape later. Come morning, the captain comes in. The group are escorted back up, straight to the mines. 
- Most of the group slacks off. The guard notices [[Afiria]] and smacks her - the same as before. [[Tycho]] speaks to another prisoner, who directs him to [[Jana]], the information broker. [[Griffith]] gathers some mica and discreetly presses it into [[Judas]]' hand - enough for two castings of shatter.
- [[Amara]] eavesdrops and listens to tales of a guy named [[Vermere]], who tried to escape. They don't know what happened to the guy, but they know that they got him somewhere outside by the ships and they didn't waste any time in hanging him. He got out by hiding in one of the transport wagons that was on the way to the ship. He got all the way to the ship but failed to get any further.
- [[Afiria]] tries to threaten someone to take their portion of work. Later, the group is taken to mealtime. [[Judas]] seeks out [[Charon]] to speak to him and tells him about what the party got up to and about [[Valerie]]. [[Judas]] asks who he should speak to in order to get the special treatment that [[Trent]] gets; [[Charon]] directs him to [[Bloodhand]] or [[Jana]]. 
- Tycho, Griffith, [[Judas]], and [[Amara]] join up to visit [[Jana]]. They offer to trade information to figure out how to get closer to the warden. [[Judas]] tells [[Jana]] that the woman's name is [[Valerie]]. [[Jana]] tells them that they have to get into favor with the warden, that [[Trent]] or the [[Bloodhand]] (Selene) can get them closer. She recommends, to get closer to the [[Bloodhand]] who is barbaric and ruthless, they might get by with violence or interesting items. They are usually found in the dining room and possess certain tattoos, so they're hard to miss.
- [[Jana]] asks [[Judas]] how he knows [[Valerie]]'s name. She tells the group that the prison warden is part of one of the largest noble families, the Ravencourts. Lots of estates around [[Kaeloris]]. Known to be the enforcers of the king, and [[Jayce]] is a pretty powerful mage. He is also known to have oddly good relationships with some prisoners. It has been said that he HAS freed them. It's unknown if that's the full truth or if things have been exaggerated, but it seems like [[Jayce Ravencourt|Jayce]] isn't that bad of a guy. He doesn't seem to agree with all the sentences that have been made.
- [[Jana]] asks them how they freed [[Valerie]], and [[Judas]] tells her how they released her, as well as her state. She says she's going to lay low, since she assumes things will get... interesting. The group parts ways with her, as she goes to make preparations. [[Amara]] splits off to get more info about [[Vermere]] while [[Judas]], [[Tycho]], and [[Griffith]] go to speak with the Bloodhands.
- [[Amara]] finds out that [[Vermere]] had found a way to get off the island without using the ships that the prison system uses.
- [[Afiria]] joins the rest of the group as they head towards the [[Bloodhand]]. The group finds some members of the [[Bloodhand]] to speak to.
