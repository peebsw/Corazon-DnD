title: Last Session Recap
collapse: open

The party washed up on a larger, warmer island and met a helpful half-elf named Harlan Avery, who offered to take them to the city of Bellnor in exchange for help dealing with strange, glowing eel-like creatures stealing from villagers. After defeating two of the creatures and investigating their electrically charged bodies, the party set sail with Harlan and arrived in Bellnor, a sprawling stone city. At the run-down Salty Wench tavern, they learned passage to the mainland would cost 50 gp each. With few options, they checked the job board, where Judas secretly ate a bounty notice for himself. The party decided to taste test a new ale for coin before tackling a high-paying ghost ship bounty.

```

#### Notes

-  The party heads down a few suspicious alleyways on their way to drink some grog. They find themselves in a brewery, where a dwarf man behind the counter is serving drinks. Judas persuades Tycho to go up to the counter to ask for the grog.
- There is a few people hanging out with him: a tall half-orc lady, a huge dwarf, and an unenthusiastic human.
- Tycho introduces himself and the party. The barkeep tells them that 5 gp per person -- 20 gp total -- will be given for every pint they drink; if they cannot drink even one pint, they will have to pay them 20 gp.
- Griffith sees a few mugs filled with various liquor. He also sees some very odd looking drinks, unevenly colored, weirdly grey. Tycho goes first, after Griffith gestures for him to look at the mugs.
- The barkeep puts out a pint of warm, coagulated liquid. Tycho tries to drink a pint. He gets a few interesting flavors before getting the strange taste of pickle juice, and an intense burning -- like the pits of hell opened up. 
- Tycho drinks and it feels like it went down fine -- at first. Then he feels an intense heat build up in his throat, and he spews a huge bout of fire directly in front of them. He singes the dwarf in front of him. The dwarf and the half-orc lady seem impressed.
- Judas drinks and is seemingly entirely unaffected. He sets down the jug and looks at the dwarf, calling it delicious. Everyone is baffled by it.
- Griffith drinks and takes 14 points of acid damage, visibly struggling and sweating.
- Judas finishes his drink. Suddenly everyone looks like chickens as he hallucinates intensely. He also has disadvantage on the next few saving throws. Amara is poisoned until the next long rest. She runs out, as she is feeling severely unwell. Judas grabs at Tycho's face, trying to get him to speak to him.
- Griffith drinks another after casting a sneaky prestidigiation . As he drinks more, he feels like the mug is getting heavier and heavier. Then he feels himself getting smaller and smaller -- and furrier. He turns into a Woolpertinger -- a tiny monster that looks like a rabbit with vampire teeth and wings. 
-  Amara rushes back to Seraphine's to get the black powder bounty. She finds Seraphine relaxing, legs on table, pirate hat on face. 
- When Amara returns, she is ecstatic over Griffith being a small creature. He concedes and lets her give him a little high five, then climbs onto her. The party decides what to do next and ultimately opts to find a place to stay for the night before they head to the ghost shop.
- The innkeeper offers them a few options: sharing with strangers, or a room for 4 people for 2 gp. Judas pays for the room. Amara offers Griffith food, then helps him up to a bed and Griffith allows her to pet him.
- Tycho takes the bottom bunk. Judas contacts his patron and says thanks for giving him a bit of luck. His patron implies that he got what he wanted in exchange for carrying around a fishbowl(?).
- His patron tells him to contact a Serella Valethorn in Kaelendell, in Khaeloris.  Judas asks why his own wanted poster is still up. The patron tells him that word travels slowly, and why would anyone expect a guy that's been wanted for 50 years would suddenly be caught. Judas asks if "she" is still alive.  
- Griffith and Amara wake; Amara is disappointed in Griffith reverting back to his normal self. They talk briefly, and he expresses that he is surprised that Amara is so into animals. Amara asks, "Isn't everyone?" Griffith disagrees.
- The party decides what to do that morning. Judas talks about going to Kaelendell, Griffith says he is also going to go. Tycho explains he needs to fight a dragon with black scales, to which the entire party agrees. He explains that he was on a hunting trip with his siblings and a dragon landed. His brother was braver and died for it, but the rest of his family fled. 
- Amara takes umbrage at Griffith asking questions, and Griffith brings up the fact that they murdered a couple of people already. He takes notes on the creature, asking Tycho everything about it. Tycho explains that he doesn't remember much, but it was located in his fiefdom. He also says his brother was the heir. Amara and Judas give their condolences.
- The party goes downstairs for breakfast. There's porridge, omelets, scrambled eggs, bacon, spinach quiche. Amara and Griffith get omelets, Judas and Tycho go for a quiche.
- The party makes their way to the contractor's location for the ghost ship bounty. Some shady folk seem to be out and about. The location is in a backroom of a proper establishment, guarded by a bouncer who seems to be turning most people away. Judas greets him and tells him they have a contract for a ghost ship. He lets the party in.
- Stairs lead downward into what looks like a basement. There are lots of golden ornaments, as well as a man on a throne who seems to be talking to a few people. Judas approaches him, bringing up the ghost ship. The man scoffs at the idea that it's a ghost ship.
- He tells them that he is running this establishment and he has been looking for people to help him out with a problem. His business is dealing with specific goods that certain people don't like being dealt. His last delivery never arrived, which caused a big problem. He needs someone to go and get the people that stole from him, but everyone believes that the culprit was some sort of ghost ship. He thinks it's bullshit; probably just some people that spread the rumor themselves to ensure no-one went after them. He doesn't care if the party kills them, he just wants them to get the treasure back. Therefore, the party should be careful to not just sink the ship.
- He also says he can't offer the party a ship with much firepower. He tells them they need to sail out to the southwestern seas, to return what's rightfully his. They also seemed to have captured his crew, which hasn't returned. If they don't manage to get the treasure back, they won't be paid. The party will be provided with a ship called the Stormskipper -- a fast one, suited to pursuing the ship. He is also going to send some of his crew with the party to help them out. 
- Amara asks if he is able to tell them exactly what is on the ship, so they know what to bring back. The man tells them there were a few goods that weren't intended for trade, such as spell scrolls, gold. 
- The man introduces himself as Morgas Fen, smuggler. He tells the party they will meet his men in the harbor -- not the normal one, as they are usually apprehended there. He tells us that the party is the first to be sent out -- allegedly. No-one else has come to take him up on the offer, as they all seem too scared of the ghost ship. 
- The party goes to the harbor where the Stormskipper is docked. There is a small ballista on the side, but it is a small sailing ship, suited for speeding after the ghost ship.
- Tycho calls out to see if anyone is on board. A scruffy, scrawny guy, Nell, the chef, who is missing an eye looks over and greets them. Tycho tells them there are the four of them, which seems to incite a bit of doubt in the man. He calls over the captain, Rell, who sports a full beard and what almost looks like a navy uniform. He has a grim look on his face. 
- He claims that the boss is ignorant to sailor traditions. A tiefling woman is also aboard on the ship. Tycho asks them to elaborate on the tradition. Rell says that it's common knowledge that you shouldn't disturb the dead, and that they probably shouldn't sail in these parts any longer. 
- They claim that they are more than capable of handling the task, and seem to be telling the truth. An elven woman, Vess, comes up from below deck. She says she's heard some reports from people that saw the ship; allegedly it had no crew and a fog gathered around it. She personally had never seen it. 
- Judas explains that once he was a cleric, and he had to learn a lot about dealing with the undead. Tycho asks if the ghosts are primarily immaterial, but the crew doesn't know. 
- The tiefling woman mocks Griffith for being older, and for being an noble. Then Judas asks Griffith how old he is; he says he doesn't know, and he hasn't celebrated a birthday. Judas asks him how he knew he was older, Griffith says it's pretty self-evident. He doesn't have it written down in his book. There is some banter before the party is asked whether they have ever fought ghosts or not before. They say no, prompting the crew to express dismay.
- Tycho asks Judas what preparations they should make, as Judas is the most knowledgeable. Judas tells them to not be afraid. Judas tells them that killing a ghost is not really killing them; it is more of a banishment. Judas explains that he was trained as a cleric from the time he was 4 years old.
- Tycho asks who his patron is; Judas calls him a pain in the ass. Judas says he never left his service, he still worships the same god, Varion. Griffith looks disgusted but does not elaborate.
- As the party sails to the correct location, they are approached and asked how they were brought together. Tycho and Judas say they were brought together by circumstance, sailing buddies. She calls Griffith your majesty some more before he dismisses her.
- First Day: the seas are pretty calm. They encounter some flotsam, which they pull out and find: 20 gp worth of goods, a potion of greater healing, and a rope of mending. 
- Second Day: A massive ship appears on the horizon; almost 3 times the size of the Stormskipper. It seems to be sailing directly towards the ship, armed heavily; but it sails past. It seemed to be a navy ship. Vess, the helmsman, expresses that he's glad they didn't seem to want anything with them.
- Third Day: Nothing happens.
- Fourth Day: There are massive stormclouds forming overhead. The sea gets rougher and rougher. Judas and Tycho get sick. 
- Fifth Day: As they sail around, nothing seems to be happening. People are getting a bit anxious. Dolphins swim next to the ship, jumping along in a race with the ship.
- Sixth Day: The whole mood seems to be shifting. The air gets unnaturally cold and a massive wall of fog seems to be settling in. It is coming from behind where they are, but even the quick ship can't seem to escape it. The Stormskipper is caught in the fog. The captain's compass is going haywire. There is something ahead of them, it seems like the rear end of the ship. Everyone is on edge. The ship is getting closer and closer. 
- The stories seem true; the deck seems entirely empty. The captain calls to drop the anchor, and they anchor near the ship. Tycho goes first, and he finds he manages to plant his foot just fine, though his foot feels weird -- almost as if it's sticking to the ship. 
- As he tries to pull it up, he notices that the ship starts to form into a tentacled abomination. It is some sort of horrible mimic.
- Initiative Order: 
	- Tycho
	- Griffith
	- Judas
	- Amara
- A tentacle tries to grab Tycho, but he manages to rip free. Griffith slam dunks the charged eel heart into one of the mimic's mouths. Amara takes out the blue tentacle; as it falls to the water, the area around it freezes. Judas gets smacked by a pseudopod, then grappled. Griffith tries to help free Judas, but the tentacle is too strong. The helmsman is downed, leaving the wheel to spin erratically. Griffith stops it with mage hand and frees Tycho by blasting the tentacle.
- Judas summons cloud of daggers on the mouth of the mimic.
